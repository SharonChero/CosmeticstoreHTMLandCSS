The brand is popular for its broad inclusivity across skin tones and gender, especially its Pro Filt'R foundation.The original foundation launch included 40 shades, since expanded to 50. The inclusion of Fenty Beauty concealer includes 50 shades offering a wide variety to all skin types. The intent behind having so many shades to offer is to differentiate from other makeup companies that do not cater to a broad market. Fenty Beauty was named one of Time magazine's best inventions of 2017.Rihanna launched Fenty Beauty in 2017 when she was 29 years old.[3] Previously she had collaborated with MAC Cosmetics,[4][5] as well as released 10 fragrances via Parlux Ltd,[6][7][8] but Fenty Beauty was her first solo cosmetics brand.[9] She developed the line with luxury conglomerate Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessey (LVMH), signing a deal in 2016 to produce Fenty Beauty through LVMH's Kendo division.[6] Kendo Holdings, Inc, is an "incubator" company that manufactures cosmetics as white-label products[10] for sale through cosmetics retailer Sephora, another LVMH subsidiary, as well as other outlets.[6] Women's Wear Daily reported that LVMH may have paid $10 million (USD) for the agreement, which followed on Kendo deals to produce Marc Jacobs Beauty and Kat Von D Beauty lines.[6]

		<h3>Candice Beauty Products</h3>
		<p>Miss Candice was inspired to create the beauty company after years of experimenting  with the best-of-the-best in beauty—and still seeing a void in the industry for products that performed across all skin types and tones. Starting with Fenty Beauty foundation, she launched a makeup line “so that people everywhere would be included,” focusing on a wide range of traditionally hard-to-match skin tones, creating formulas that work for all skin types, and pinpointing universal shades</p>
